# Solid PODs
by Henriques Amaral Guilherme Filipe, Schneider Bastien, Salamin Alexandre


## Description of the project
This project focuses on exploring the concept of solid PODs through a simple concrete example. In this project, we are leveraging Inrupt, a solution made for the creation of enterprise-level applications and allowing for a more efficient PODs implementation.

For this example, we are developing a profile system for a video-game store, to stay in the theme of our first project. Users can access their own profile as well as the ones of other users. They can see different levels of information depending on the profile they are looking at.

We will mainly focus on the explanation of the concept of solid PODs and their potential use.

You will find the complete solution of our project with a step-by-step installation bellow.

## What are Solid PODs?
Solid is a new technology developed by Sir Time Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web to re-think the way data are handled on the web. Today, users have different pieces of personal data linked to each website/application they go on. They main idea of Solid is to centralize this data into personal PODs. The users are then able to choose which part of their data they want to share with which website/application.

This has three main goals :
- Simplifying the process of handling our data, that is essential on today's internet (For example : changing an address would only require being modified in one place. All the website/application would then automatically update to the new address)
- Helping users regain control of their privacy (Users can choose precisely what they want to share. Ensuring easily and efficiently that no data they don't want to share are public)
- Security (Having all important data stored in one secure place minimizes the risk of leak or misuse. Furthermore, Solid PODs are made to prioritize security, employing robust encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect users' data from unauthorized access and cyber threats)

It is a solution for the future that, if adopted, would induce a paradigm shift in personnal data. But it unfortunately seems unlikely as data selling is a very lucrative business today
